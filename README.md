## Why

Often we want to use a restroom when we are out, but how do we find one we know
is most often clean? How do we even know where the nearest restroom is?

We set out to build a solution for the CSULA Staff and Student Body.

## Challenges :warning:

Like all software teams, we also ran into hiccups
- Collecting Data
- Merge conflicts
